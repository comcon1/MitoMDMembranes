# About

The repository contains data for modelling of slightly oxidized model mitochondrial membrane. Here we put models of monohydroperoxides of tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin as well as models of two BODIPY-based dyes sensitive to lipid peroxidation.

The deposited data supplements the original research:
