# About

The repository contains data for modelling of slightly oxidized model mitochondrial membrane. Here we put models of monohydroperoxides of tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin as well as models of two BODIPY-based dyes sensitive to lipid peroxidation.

The deposited data supplements the original research:

# Example system

This is an example system containing PLPC, PSLPE, POPC, oxidized TCLC and MitoCLOx dye.

# Repository structure
Into the `ff.construction` folder we put the protocols for parametrization for BODIPY-based dye and hydroperoxide of lynoleic acid. The `forcefield` folder contains ready GROMACS topologies and all files needed for compiling GROMACS binary file with the sample system. In the `model.bilayers` there are many subfolders with different types of mitochondrial model membranes, which differs with the type of lynoleic acid hydroperoxides in the TLCL molecules.
