Here, you can find two molecules in two possible conformations.

## TT

.. means "trans-trans"
                 
    CCC(-OOH)C=C-C=C-CC
              ^   ^
            trans trans
## CT

.. means "cis-trans"
                 
    CCC(-OOH)C=C-C=C-CC
              ^   ^
            trans cis

We used charges in both conformations and averaged them to make the single patch to the force field.
