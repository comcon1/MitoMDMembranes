To patch the force field and introduce monohydroperoxidized cardiolipids, we tested our charges for reproducing PES for rotation of the -C=C-C=C- dihedral.

Here, you can find ProfileMD files for rotating this angle in the molecule:
                 
    CCC(-OOH)C=C-C=C-CC
                ^

Please consult `bodipy.dyes/example.md.scan` subfolder for details of restarting of MD PES scan.
